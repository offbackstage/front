  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p class="opacity--50">Last updated: 01 Jan 2021 (Effective 01 Jan 2021)</p>
  <p>Because of a new data privacy law that is being introduced in the EU on 25 May 2018, we’ll be sharing some more information with you about how we collect and use your personal information.</p>
  <p>Over the last months, we have taken great care in preparing for this change in European law to ensure that all of our processes, tech-infrastructure, partners and policies comply with GDPR. Nothing will change on how you use OffBackstage. We will just provide you with more power and control over your personal data.</p>

  <h2>Here’s a summary of what GDPR actually means for you:</h2>
